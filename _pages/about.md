I am a PhD candidate at [BU SecLab](https://seclab.bu.edu/) working with Professor [Gianluca Stringhini](https://seclab.bu.edu/people/gianluca/). My research focuses on building systems to improve the state of content moderation on social media. I borrow tools from Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, Statistics, etc. to build tools that can help platforms flag misleading content in their services at scale. My other areas of interest are Internet Measurement, Technology and Policy, and Cybersecurity. In my past life, I used to work on web development, and mobile app development and actively participated in [Hackathons](https://devpost.com/codepujan).
